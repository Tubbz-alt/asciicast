asciicast takes an R script and turns it into an
[asciiname](https://asciinema.org/) cast. It can simulate typing, and
records all terminal output in real time as it happens.

## Features

* Input is a simple R script, output is a
  [v2 asciinema recording](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/blob/develop/doc/asciicast-v2.md).
* Record all terminal output in real time, as it happens.
* Alternatively, whole comment blocks or expressions can just appear on
  the screen.
* Convert casts to SVG images using
  [svg-term](https://github.com/marionebl/svg-term). The package comes with
  its own svg-term bundle, no external dependencies are needed.
* Render a single frame of a cast as an SVG image.
* Configurable delay at the beginning, at the end and between paragraphs.

## Limitations

* asciicast does not work in Windows yet, because of a the lack of a
  pseudo terminal. Maybe you can try running it on Linux in Docker?
* Recordings are currently real time, so if you "type in" a lot of
  code/text, that might take a while to record.
* Only syntactically correct R script files can be recorded.
* asciicast redefines `option("error")` currently, so if you want to
  set this option in your demo, that won't work.

## Installation

You can install the released version of asciicast from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org):

``` r
install.packages("asciicast")
```
