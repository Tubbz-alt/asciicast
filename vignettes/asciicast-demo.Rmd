## Example

This is an example vignette for creating asciinema ascii screen casts.
To include a screencast in your document, you need to do two steps.
The first is to initialize the asciicast engine:

````
```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}`r ''`
asciicast::init_knitr_engine()
```
````

```{r echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
asciicast::init_knitr_engine()
```

After this, for the chunks that you want to display as an ascii cast,
use the asciicast engine:

````
```{asciicast}`r ''`
# This will be an ascii cast
# Let's evaluate some code
head(mtcars)
```
````

This will produce the following cast:

```{asciicast}
# This will be an ascii cast
# Let's evaluate some code
head(mtcars)
```

## Changing parameters

You can include a DCF header in the asciicast, to set some parameters, e.g.
the height of the widget.

````
```{asciicast}`r ''`
#' Height: 10

# No much here, so avoid a big widget
1 + 2 + 3 + 4
```
````

```{asciicast}
#' Height: 5

# Not much here, so avoid a big widget
1 + 2 + 3 + 4
```

## Casting a script from a file

It is possible to read the R code of a cast from a file, instead of
specifying it in the code chunk. The advantage of this is that it is easier
to use the code in the R scripts for other purposes.

````
```{asciicast file = "../inst/examples/hello.R"}`r ''`
```
````

```{asciicast file = "../inst/examples/hello.R"}
```

See the documentation for the other parameters that you can set in the
header. Enjoy!
